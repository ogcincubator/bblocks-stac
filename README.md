# STAC Building Blocks 

This expresses the implementation of the STAC specification in the form of [Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/). 

The generated documentation of each Building Block can be accessed [here](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-stac/).

STAC extends [OGC API features](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-ogcapi-features)

These building blocks provide additional annotation and testing of:

1. examples
2. Mappings to related semantic models (JSON-LD contexts)
3. Alignments (tested using transformations to related standards)
4. Profile options (formalised machine readable hierarchies)
5. Linked Data view of available resources

_Building Blocks do not change the underlying specification but provide an extra layer of coherence to support the FAIR principles for interoperability specifications._

[GeoDCAT](https://ogcincubator.github.io/geodcat-ogcapi-features/) uses STAC to  inform requirements and implements a binding of various STAC profiles to relevant descriptive ontologies as well as the GeoDCAT model.
