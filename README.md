# STAC Building Blocks 

This expresses the implementation of the STAC specification in the form of OGC BuildingBlocks. 

These building blocks provide additional annotation and testing of:

1. examples
2. Mappings to related semantic models (JSON-LD contexts)
3. Alignments (tested using transformations to related standards)
4. Profile options (formalised machine readable hierarchies)
5. Linked Data view of available resources

_Building Blocks do not change the underlying specification but provide an extra layer of coherence to support the FAIR principles for interoperability specifications._
