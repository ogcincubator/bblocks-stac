# STAC Building Blocks 

This expresses the implementation of the STAC specification and selected extensions as [Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/). 


_Building Blocks do not change the underlying specification but provide an extra layer of coherence to support the FAIR principles for interoperability specifications._

This has the following advantages:

1. Allows declaration of dependencies between STAC extensions
2. Provides a register of STAC extensions in a form that can be integrated into the wider OGC knowledge base
3. Allows for additional testing of correctness of examples and compatibility of extensions
4. Provides a framework for defining profiles of STAC extensions, either through choice of options or through integration with other STAC extensions.

The generated documentation of each Building Block can be accessed [here](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-stac/).

NB It is a design constraint on [OGC API Records](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-ogcapi-records) that it is compatible with STAC extends [OGC API features] and this is
