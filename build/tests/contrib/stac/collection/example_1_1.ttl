    dcterms:description """Sentinel-2 is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral
imaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,
including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,
as well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.

The Sentinel-2 data contain 13 UINT16 spectral bands representing
TOA reflectance scaled by 10000. See the [Sentinel-2 User Handbook](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/Sentinel-2_User_Handbook)
for details. In addition, three QA bands are present where one
(QA60) is a bitmask band with cloud mask information. For more
details, [see the full explanation of how cloud masks are computed.](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-1c/cloud-masks)

Each Sentinel-2 product (zip archive) may contain multiple
granules. Each granule becomes a separate Earth Engine asset.
EE asset ids for Sentinel-2 assets have the following format:
COPERNICUS/S2/20151128T002653_20151128T102149_T56MNN. Here the
first numeric part represents the sensing date and time, the
second numeric part represents the product generation date and
time, and the final 6-character string is a unique granule identifier
indicating its UTM grid reference (see [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System)).

For more details on Sentinel-2 radiometric resoltuon, [see this page](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/resolutions/radiometric).
