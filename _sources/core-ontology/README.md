# STAC Ontology

This BBlock defines the **ontology** and **SHACL shape** for the STAC schema

## Purpose

To provide Linked Data support for STAC.

Note that mapping STAC elements to an ontology using JSON-LD it is possible to define validation rules and inherit them in profiles.

This ontology provides the common baseline for all extensions, dramatically reducing overhead for each extension to self-describe.
