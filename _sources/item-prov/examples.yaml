    a STAC item is a prov:Entity with the "wasGeneratedBy" property defined by PROV-O.

  snippets:
    - language: json

    A STAC item is a prov:Entity with the "wasGeneratedBy" property defined by PROV-O.

- title: STAC item with a provenance graph
  content: |
    This is the simple item example from the STAC specification, augmented an array of Provenance objects that define a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that can fully describe a set of contributing activities, entities and agents.) 

    A STAC item is a prov:Entity with the "has_provenance" property whose range is an array of objects defined by the PROV-O model. 

  snippets:
    - language: json
      ref: examples/item-prov-dag.json
      base-uri: 'https://example.com/stac/example1/'
