  "abstract": "An item can describe assets that are rasters of one or multiple bands with some information common to them all (raster size, projection) and also specific to each of them (data type, unit, number of bits used, nodata). A raster is often strongly linked with the georeferencing transform and coordinate system definition of all bands (using the projection extension). In many applications, it is interesting to have some metadata about the rasters in the asset (values statistics, value interpretation, transforms).",
